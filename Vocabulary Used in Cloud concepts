Cloud Computing
•	Definition: The use of remote servers (over the internet) to store, manage, and process data instead of using a local computer or server.
Cloud Service Models
•	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Renting computing resources (like servers, storage) over the cloud. You manage the software, but the hardware is managed by the provider.
•	Platform as a Service (PaaS): A platform that provides tools for building and deploying applications. You focus on coding, while the provider manages infrastructure and services.
•	Software as a Service (SaaS): Software delivered over the internet on a subscription basis (e.g., Gmail, Microsoft Office 365).
Public Cloud
•	Definition: Cloud services provided by third-party vendors (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure) and shared with many customers.
Private Cloud
•	Definition: A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization, offering greater control over data security and performance.
Hybrid Cloud
•	Definition: A mix of private and public cloud services that allows data and applications to be shared between them. It provides flexibility and more deployment options.
. Cloud Deployment Models
•	Definition: Different ways of using cloud computing (Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community clouds).
Region
•	Definition: A geographic area where cloud data centers are located. Cloud providers have multiple regions worldwide, allowing you to choose where to store and process your data.
 Availability Zone (AZ)
•	Definition: A specific, isolated location within a region that contains data centers. Multiple AZs in a region ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
 Edge Location
•	Definition: Small data centers located closer to end-users. They help deliver content (like videos or websites) quickly by caching data closer to where users are located.
Cloud Storage
•	Definition: Storing data on remote servers (in the cloud) that can be accessed via the internet, instead of storing it on local hard drives.
Cloud Migration
•	Definition: The process of moving data, applications, or other business elements from an on-premises data center or legacy system to a cloud environment.
Virtualization
•	Definition: Creating virtual versions of resources like servers, storage, and networks to improve efficiency and resource utilization. It’s a key technology for cloud computing.
Multi-Cloud
•	Definition: Using more than one cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) to avoid dependency on a single vendor and improve flexibility.
Scalability
•	Definition: The ability to adjust cloud resources (like computing power or storage) up or down based on demand. It helps businesses avoid over- or under-provisioning.
Elasticity
•	Definition: The cloud’s ability to automatically scale resources up or down in real-time based on usage, providing cost efficiency and performance optimization.
Load Balancer
•	Definition: A tool that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, improving performance and reliability.
 Disaster Recovery (DR)
•	Definition: The process of recovering data and applications after a failure, often by using cloud services to back up data and ensure business continuity.
Cloud Security
•	Definition: Measures taken to protect cloud systems, data, and applications from unauthorized access, breaches, and attacks. This includes encryption, identity management, and firewalls.
API (Application Programming Interface)
•	Definition: A set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and work together. APIs are used in cloud environments to integrate services.
Containers
•	Definition: A lightweight, portable way to package and deploy applications. Containers allow software to run consistently across different environments.
Microservices
•	Definition: A design approach where an application is built as a set of small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.
Serverless Computing
•	Definition: A cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages all the infrastructure, and users only pay for the compute resources used during execution, without having to manage servers.
 API Gateway
•	Definition: A server that acts as an entry point to manage and route API requests between the user and backend services.
Container Orchestration
•	Definition: Managing the deployment, scaling, and networking of containers in cloud environments, often using tools like Kubernetes.
Cloud Monitoring
•	Definition: The process of tracking the performance and health of cloud resources, ensuring they are operating optimally and securely.
Cost Optimization
•	Definition: Managing and adjusting cloud resources to minimize costs while maintaining performance and reliability.
Cloud Native
•	Definition: Applications built specifically for the cloud, designed to take full advantage of cloud infrastructure, scalability, and flexibility.
 SLA (Service Level Agreement)
•	Definition: A contract between a cloud provider and customer that defines the expected level of service, including uptime, support, and response times.
Data Replication
•	Definition: The process of copying data across multiple locations or systems to ensure redundancy and availability in case of failure.
Auto-scaling
•	Definition: The automatic adjustment of cloud resources (like adding or removing virtual machines) based on current demand to ensure optimal performance.
